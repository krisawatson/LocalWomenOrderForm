            than e-mail, please specify that at time of sale in the box provided (see reverse). All advertisements that have been
            written and agreed by you (the client) and the sales representative must proceed according to what has been agreed. In the
            event that you fail to supply copy, or are not available for a photo shoot, you will be still charged as per your contract
            and no alternative will be offered. We will retain an electronic record of all proofs sent out by our company, however, we
            cannot be held responsible if clients do not check their e-mail account. All invoices must be paid within 15 days of
            publication.</div>
